Mypy plugin describing ``fastenum`` classes' interface:

  - attribute access
  - iterating over class definition
  - ``__getitem__`` access

  - https://medium.com/@erick.peirson/type-checking-with-json-schema-in-python-3244f3917329

Source code inspiration (many things were taken from existing plugins):
  - https://github.com/python/mypy/tree/master/mypy/plugins (all)
  - https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/plugins/dataclasses.py
  - https://github.com/python/mypy/blob/master/mypy/plugins/attrs.py


We added explanations where necessary. Please go through the module
and read it in the following order:

  #. :code:`def plugin(_: str) -> Type[FastEnumPlugin]:`
      - Defines the plugin itself - this is what will be registered as a plugin.
      - You can return different implementations based on the mypy version (which is the only argument).
  #. :code:`class FastEnumPlugin(mypy.plugin.Plugin):`
      - The mypy plugin, which is just a hook-registering class
      - See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending_mypy.html#high-level-overview
      - We are using two main hooks:
        - :code:`get_type_analyze_hook` to change the type definition mypy sees;
        - :code:`get_base_class_hook` to change the class definition inherited from the :code:`Enum` class.
  #. As the first hook handler please read :code:`transform_enum_class_def` which intercepts
     the class definition. As part of this reading go through :code:`_define_method`
      - This should be the simpler part and more understandable.
  #. After understanding the previous part go to :code:`transform_enum_type`
      - This is a bit magical, as we redefine :code:`Enum` and :code:`EnumMeta` for mypy.

The last thing is how this plugin is registered which is a bit sad in mypy
because the only thing you can do is intercept fullnames (module, classname, method, ...)
of any AST object and tell mypy whether you want to do something with that object.

But once you return your hook handler - there is no way back.
So for example Enum-inherited classes can be seen from mypy as these fullnames:

  - :code:`controllers.orders.types.fastenum`
  - :code:`main.Enum`

So this way we will collide with the original Enum definition in the Python standard library
- which should still work with our plugin however.

	See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending_mypy.html#current-list-of-plugin-hooks for
	more information about hooks.

	It gives us the ability to get the defined type and AST nodes representing how
	mypy sees our class (inherited from Enum) and perform any changes we want.

	This hook is called after :code:`get_type_analyze_hook` hook which is handled by :code:`transform_enum_type`
	so the type of the super class is slightly altered after that.

	But if we inspect :code:`context.cls` which is of type :code:`nodes.ClassDef` (an AST node)
	we get something like:

	  ::
	    ClassDef:3(
	    Color
	    BaseType(_fastenum.Enum)
	    AssignmentStmt:4(
	      NameExpr(RED [m])
	      IntExpr(1)
	      builtins.int)

	      NameExpr(GREEN [m])

	    AssignmentStmt:6(
	      NameExpr(BLUE [m])
	      IntExpr(3)
	      builtins.int))

	And by inspecting :code:`context.cls.info` which is of type :code:`nodes.TypeInfo` - still an AST node
	but one which defines the type of our class (where previous defined class definition) you'll get:

	  ::
	    TypeInfo(
	      Name(main.Color)
	      Bases(_fastenum.Enum)
	      Mro(main.Color, _fastenum.Enum, builtins.object)

	        GREEN (builtins.int)
	        RED (builtins.int))
	      MetaclassType(_fastenum.EnumMeta))


	From these you can see that mypy sees our class attributes as int, str or any value our enum has
	but not as Enum class instances. So we have to update that.

def transform_enum_type(context: mypy.plugin.AnalyzeTypeContext) -> types.Type:
	'''
	This is registered as a handler of the :code:`get_type_analyze_hook` hook
	See https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending_mypy.html#current-list-of-plugin-hooks for
	more information about hooks.

	This will be the first hook called in this plugin.
	It allows us to change or alter type definitions as mypy sees them.

	This is needed because our Enum uses :code:`EnumMeta` class which defines :code:`__new__`
	and it shadows everything for mypy. So without this callback our type
	visible by mypy would look like following in :code:`transform_enum_class_def`
	hook handler. (Please read comment in :code:`transform_enum_class_def`).

	  ::
	    ClassDef:3(
	      Color
	      FallbackToAny
	      AssignmentStmt:4(
	        NameExpr(RED [m])
	        IntExpr(1)

	        BLUE (builtins.int)
	        GREEN (builtins.int)
	        RED (builtins.int)))

	Please check docs to :code:`transform_enum_class_def` method
	where you can se what these types look like when this hook
	is used.

	For example you can see that :code:`TypeInfo` is completely missing
	  - inheritance to Enum type
	  - metaclass definition

	So it would be possible to change attribute types without this hook
	but we have to add a metaclass for :code:`__iter__` and :code:`__getitem__` definitions.

	To do this we have to describe what :code:`Enum` and :code:`EnumMeta` look like.
	We did not find how to tell mypy to give us these definitions
	so we described them manually in this part, and then properly
	added inheritance to any :code:`Enum` inherited class to our fake :code:`Enum`.
